# PurpleRain
This simple game using an Adafruit Trinket, a Pimoroni UnicornHAT and a sliding potentiometer as the controller.

The principle is to move the player (blue dot) left or right to avoid the purple rain drops as they fall.  Over time the game increases in speed and more rain drops appear.  The position of the rain is randomly generated.
